App currently used on a daily basis in my current place of employment - DTP-SOFT sp. z o.o.<br />

tl:dr
- Allows users to pick one of two profiles that determines which notifications he/she will receive <br />
- Add products to a list stored in a cloud (MongoDB Realm) and notify others about it <br />
- Once a product is prepared, hit done and move it to a secondary list as it awaits for a coworker to grab it <br />

This minimizes time lost to communicate between teams, and makes tracking current tasks much easier.
